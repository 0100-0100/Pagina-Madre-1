## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions (carry forward)

- Cedula as username pattern established
- Session security with HTTPONLY, SAMESITE
- Custom middleware for global auth
- Bootstrap 5.3.8 via jsDelivr CDN with SRI
- Real-time validation with 1.5s debounce
- Input filtering for form fields
- Three-step migration for unique fields
- Self-referential ForeignKey with SET_NULL
- filter().first() for graceful referral lookup
- Django PasswordChangeView extension
- navigator.clipboard API for copy functionality
- ORM broker with SQLite for task queue (<100 users)
- Single worker (workers=1) for SQLite write safety
- WAL mode via connection_created signal
- timeout=120s, retry=180s for cedula validation tasks
- 9 granular status choices for CedulaInfo lifecycle
- TextField for raw_response (debug storage, not queried)
- Spanish verbose_names for all user-facing fields
- Role enum inside CustomUser class for namespacing (CustomUser.Role.USER)
- CedulaInfoAdmin fully read-only (data from scraping only)
- Role field read-only for non-superusers
- Browser singleton with lazy initialization for Playwright
- Fresh context per scrape with cleanup in finally block
- Headed browser mode when DEBUG=True for visual debugging

### v1.3 Research Insights

- Django-Q2 with ORM broker (SQLite compatible) - IMPLEMENTED
- SQLite WAL mode required to prevent locking - IMPLEMENTED
- Single worker only (Q_CLUSTER.workers = 1) - IMPLEMENTED
- Playwright-stealth for F5 bypass (success not guaranteed)
- transaction.on_commit() for signal-triggered tasks
- Fresh browser instance per task (no sharing) - IMPLEMENTED via context isolation

### Pending Todos

(None)

### Blockers/Concerns

- F5 CSPM bot detection may block scraper (build for graceful failure)
